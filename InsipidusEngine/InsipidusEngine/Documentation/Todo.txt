/// Todo
- Perhaps incorporate the modified sprite system from the java game?
- Determine the best way to design and handle a move's outcome, ie. if it misses or hits.

/// Done
- Strictly choreographed battles may prove to be to cumbersome and unflexible. Perhaps a more direct version is better in the long run?
- Add visual elements to attacks, ie. add a sprite collection to timeline events.
- Due to Vector2 being immutable (or something similar) any event relying on homing in on a position needs some extra work. Currently only a character's position is used.
