/// World

The world will be a mix between 3D and 2D. A heightmap approach will be taken to the terrain at large while each entity will have its own body of vertices.
In order to simplify things no models are allowed and all shapes present (except for the terrain) must use a simple geometrical form, such as a cube.
The entity's texture will be wrapped around this shape.
